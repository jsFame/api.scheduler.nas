# Schedule sessions with dean 

# Inspiration

During my college years, I found that teachers, students & myself would often have to stand outside the
dean's office for long hours. I found this very disturbing as a Computer Science Engineering Student. I saw the potential of 
a software scheduler that would make everyone's life easy.
